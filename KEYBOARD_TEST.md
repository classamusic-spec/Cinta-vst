# Test CINTA with Computer Keyboard

The Cmajor player has a built-in computer keyboard to MIDI feature.

## Try This Now:

1. **Click on the black Cmajor player window** to make sure it's focused
2. **Press these keys on your COMPUTER keyboard** (not MIDI keyboard):
   - Press **A** key - should play C note
   - Press **S** key - should play D note  
   - Press **D** key - should play E note
   - Press **F** key - should play F note
   - Press **G** key - should play G note

If you hear beeps when pressing these computer keys, the synth works and it's just a MIDI keyboard routing issue.

If you don't hear anything, there may be an audio output problem.

## What the keys do:
- **A S D F G H J K** = White keys (C D E F G A B C)
- **W E T Y U** = Black keys (C# D# F# G# A#)
- **Z X** = Octave down/up
- **C V** = Velocity down/up

Try it now!
